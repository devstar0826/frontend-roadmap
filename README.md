React Developer Roadmap 2019

*Just a bunch of links for now*

#### Side Notes

**Subject Isolation:** it's easier to learn everything in isolation. I suggest you to avoid course which conflate many subjects. 
Two subjects, like DOM & JavaScript may be fine but you should avoid 999-part series (common at Udemy...). Ideally, you should practice each topic immediately after the theory. Longer series make you to delay practice and forget what you learned as a result.

**Platforms:** there are basically 3 main video sites: PluralSight, FrontendMasters and EggHead. Other sites, like Udemy may have some gems but, in average, aren't good enough to bother with subscriptions i.m.o. EggHead format works better for smaller, more focused topics while PluralSight & FrontendMasters really shine for larger, more general topics. So, say, if you want to learn a library (Redux?) – check EggHead first. If, hovewer, you want to learn programming basics – check to the other two.
